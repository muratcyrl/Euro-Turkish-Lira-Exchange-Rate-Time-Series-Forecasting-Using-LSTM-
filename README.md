# Euro-Turkish Lira Exchange Rate Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM 
That project was created using LSTM, which a RNN model. Thus, It might make mistakes.
LSTM was implemented on this project in order to forecast Turkish Lira-Euro exchange rates for the following 30 days. You have to setup some libraries to be able to progress. Apart from that, do not take serious the results produced using that model. 
The main purpose of the project is to demonstrate how succesfully the LSTM model works on the time series data. In addition, the trained model can be utilized on real time seris data as well.
