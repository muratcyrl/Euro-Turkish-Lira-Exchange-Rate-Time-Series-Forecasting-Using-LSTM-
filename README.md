# Euro-Turkish Lira Exchange Rate Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM 
That project was created using LSTM, which a RNN model. Thus, It might make mistakes.
LSTM was implemented on this project in order to forecast the following 30 days of Turkish Lira-Euro exchange rate. You have to setup some libraries to be able to use that project. Apart from that, do not take serious the results produced using that model. 
The main purpose of the project is to show how succesfully the LSTM model works on time series data. In addition, 
You have to setup some libraries to be able to use that project.
